# Feedback Form


## Description

This application will allow students to provide feedback on how well they are handling the topics of the course. The feedback form will ask students to assess their feeling and understanding of the materials being discussed in the course. They will also be able to provide feedback on the level of the support they are receiving from the course instructors. All three of these inputs(feeling, understanding, & support level) will be scored on a level of 1-5 and students are required select a score. If no score is selected, students will be prompted to select one before being able to continue. At the end of the form, students will be allowed to enter comments about the material course and/or their understanding. The comments portion of the feedback form is optional. 

Students can click the 'admin' icon in the header of the page and see all their feedback responses ordered by the date the feedback was entered.
